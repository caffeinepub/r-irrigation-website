# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add online scheduling functionality and replace the site logo with the user-provided image.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a new scheduling page with a service request form including customer details, service type, preferred date/time, and notes
- Add "Schedule Service" navigation link in the header menu
- Add "Schedule Service" call-to-action buttons in the hero section and CTA block
- Replace the existing R Irrigation logo with the user-provided logo image throughout the site

**User-visible outcome:** Customers can schedule service appointments through an online form accessible from the navigation menu and prominent call-to-action buttons. The site displays the new R Irrigation logo with shield design and water/grass elements.
